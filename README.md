# Volatility-Scaled Trend-Following Strategy

This strategy dynamically adjusts position size based on market volatility and only takes long positions in the S&P 500 when the price is above its 200-day moving average. It aims to reduce drawdowns while maintaining exposure during strong uptrends — outperforming a traditional buy-and-hold approach over the last 10 years.
